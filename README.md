# Mandala Art

### 
ðŸ“ŽFor this project, it took me a while to finish because I wasnâ€™t satisfied with the design and I revised it a lot. I experimented with the design by using different lines to produce a variety of patterns. I used a pink background, violet for the mandala because it is my favorite color, and a black pen to make it look clean.
